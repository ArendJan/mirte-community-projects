## MIRTE Master Robot - SINDYc & Tube NMPC
Elysia Bonello<sub>October 2025</sub>

[elbon1/mirte-master-tube_nmpc](https://github.com/elbon1/mirte-master-tube_nmpc): modelling and robust trajectory tracking of the MIRTE Master omnidirectional robot. Modelling is performed with SINDYc (sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics with control), and control uses tube-based nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) with a discrete linear-quadratic regulator (DLQR) ancillary law.

## Model-Based-Control for Trajectory Tracking with a Mecanum Wheeled Vehicle
Tim van der Spijk <sub>July 2024</sub>

Investigates the benefits of using a trajectory tracking controller based on a dynamic model for a four-Mecanum-wheeled vehicle (FMWV) over a kinematic-model-based controller.
